Procedure for modifying EnergyPlus weather files:

1) Run the weather converter on the EPW file associated with the weather location of interest. 
   The default location for the EnergyPlus weather converter (weather.exe) is 
   C:\EnergyPlusV8-6-0\PreProcess\WeatherConverter
2) Choose the option to convert the EPW file to "CSV format of EPW data"
3) Open the EnergyPlus CSV file in Excel
4) Make the modifications required. In the case of no matching ASHRAE design data location for a CWEC file
   location, this can be fixed by changing the 6 digit station number reference at the end of the string 
   in cell A2 to a station number close to the CWEC location that has ASHRAE design data. 
5) Save the CSV file (keep as CSV rather than changing to a workbook)
6) Run the weather converter again, this time selecting the CSV file as the input and override the default 
   type to set it to "EnergyPlus Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format"
7) Choose the output format as EPW. 

This will generate a new set of .epw, .ddy and .stat files.
