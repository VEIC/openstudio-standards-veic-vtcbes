Input Assumptions for Building Energy Models ,,
"Computer simulation models were used to estimate the energy usage in buildings. Simulation models predict the energy consumption and interaction of building systems. 11 buildings have been modelled and will represent the other similar building types - 'archetypes' - throughout the Base.  This document lists the inputs or assumptions that were used in the computer models.  Wherever possible, the actual equipment, occupancy, schedules and operating values were used in the models. Otherwise, assumptions were based on typical values from the Canadian building code, known as the Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB). ",,

Item,Canmet Energy's Assumptions and Values,4 Wing Comments?
Weather (historical weather data),Edmonton average weather data. A data file called Canadian Weather year for Energy Calculation (CWEC),
,,
Occupancy,,
number of occupants in buildings,Building Code values adjusted for the actual occupancy reported in the audit,
occupancy schedules in buildings,actual schedules reported in the audit ,
,,
Building Construction,,
insulation levels in walls and ceilings,"estimated from the building plans, including renovations to walls and roofs (see attached sheet 'R-values')",
air tightness / air leakage,estimated from a  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study (see attached sheet 'Infiltration Rates'),
 ,, 
Lighting,,
type of lamps,"metal halides in the bay spaces of recreation centres, storage buildings, workshops, and hangars. Otherwise all T8 fluorescents", 
lighting density (Watts/m2 of floor area),Building Code values used to estimate the number of lamps per square metre of floor area ,
contribution to space heating,"In most spaces, lights generate heat that contributes to useful space heating and also contributes to summer cooling loads. This is not the case in bay spaces where the heat from lights does not reach occupants.", 
schedule,Same as building occupancy schedule reported in the audit  ,
,,
Plug Loads, , 
plug loads (Watts/m2 of floor area),Building Code values, 
schedule,Building Code values,
,,
Heating Equipment,,
heating system capacity,auto-sized by the computer model based on heat loss calculation and design temperatures, 
AHU and RTU heating side efficiency,"actual if available, otherwise 80% for direct fired equipment", 
space temperature setpoint, 20 °C average assumed for all buildings and spaces,
boiler capacity,auto-sized by the computer model,
boiler efficiency,"actual if available, otherwise 80%. 80% estimated for central plant heated buildings",
hot water setpoint,82 °C,
boiler with outdoor air reset control,installed in central plant heated buildings; not installed in other buildings,
nighttime temperature setback,not currently practiced in any buildings, 
HVAC night control,"assume zone thermal units (if applicable) can cycle on to meet heating setpoint. may be fan coil, terminal unit, baseboard, or RTU ",
,,
Main Heating Pumps,,
flow capacity and horsepower,auto-sized by the computer model,
pump motor efficiency,adjusted according to age of building,
pump speed,"constant, single-speed",
,,
Cooling Equipment,,
cooling system capacity,auto-sized by the computer model based on heat loss calculation and design temperatures, 
space temperature setpoint, 24 °C average for cooled spaces,
cooling efficiency,the coefficient of performance (COP) for cooling equipment and air conditioners is corelated to building age: 2.5 for systems pre-1980; 3.0 for 1980-2004; 3.5 post-2004,
spaces with cooling,"cooling is assumed for spaces with occupants only, for example in offices but not in storage spaces; also based upon actual information from audits",
free cooling economizers,assume economizers are installed and operating in all AHUs and RTUs,
,,
Ventilation,"including AHUs, MUAs, RTUs, exhaust fans, ceiling fans, transfer air fans",
fan capacity and horsepower,"auto-sized by the computer model. Fan power is estimated separately for supply, return and exhaust fans using typical static pressure of AHUs ",
fan speed,constant speed,
fan motor efficiency,adjusted according to age of building,
ventilation fresh air requirement,"Building Code outdoor air per person rates, and occupancy levels from audit",
ventilation schedule ,"always on (assumption is the heating and cooling setpoints are met, and fresh air requirement for number of occupants only). Ventilation runs through the night same as daytime", 
exhaust fans capacity and schedule,"actual values reported in audit, otherwise assume 24 hour operation",
,,
Domestic Hot Water,,
peak flow and temperature,"based on Building Code values for temperature, litres and draw profiles",
water tank capacity,Building Code value, 
water tank efficiency,"actual if available otherwise 80% for gas-fired, 100% for electric with standby losses taken into account separately ",
schedule,based on predominant Building Code space type,
water heater pumps,horsepower autosized by computer model; runs constantly,
fuel type ,based on audit,
,,
Miscellaneous,,
humidification/dehumidification,no humidification is assumed; dehumidification accounted for by cooling,
combining systems,separate HVAC equipment was sometimes combined in order to simplify computer modelling,
HVAC system type v.s. age of building?,the type of HVAC equipment was not correlated to the building's age because buildings have undergone so many retrofits and added new heating and ventilation systems ,
Firehall  ,use Trenton Firehall and run with Edmonton weather data. The Cold Lake Firehall is the same building design as Trenton's.,
B172 CF18 Training  ,use Trenton Training archetype building and run with Edmonton weather data. No building plans were made available by Cold Lake for this building.,
