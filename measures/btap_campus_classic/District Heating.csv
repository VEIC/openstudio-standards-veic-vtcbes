District Heating,,,,
Item, Canmet Energy's Assumptions and Questions,Buildings using Steam directly in their heating systems,,
Heating Network,,Bldg No.,Building Name,4 Wing please list the terminal heating equipment using steam
,"·         All network modelling will assume integration of a hot water distribution network (~110 °C design supply temperature), constructed over 3 phases:",H1,Hangar 1,
," Phase 1: connect to buildings currently supplied with steam from the CHP, and omitting any buildings slated to be demolished",B177,F404 Engine Bay/Composite Bldg,
," Phase 2/3: connect to buildings currently heated with individual gas-fired systems as seen practical, as well as future buildings to be constructed",H2,Hangar 2,
,"·         Piping assumed to be new, thin-walled steel district heating pipe (preinsulated, bonded) to be direct buried at approximately 1 metre below grade.",H4,Hangar 4,"hangar door floor blast heaters , 2 steam coils"
,"·         In an effort to generate conservative estimates for required network piping, analysis will be based upon the estimated base-case (pre-ECM) building heating loads and no diversity or simultaneity of network heating loads will be considered.",H3,Hangar 3,
,,H6,Hangar 6,
Potential Central Heating Plant options,,B171,Supply Warehouse,
,·         New gas-fired hot water boilers.,B5,WTN Garage,
,·         Investigate other alternative supply options including biomass boilers and cogeneration.,B7,CE Main Bldg,
,·         Modelled plant to be located at or near the existing CHP building unless directed otherwise.,B63,GSAR/Battery Shop/Supply,
,·         Modelled plant operation and fuel consumption analysis will factor estimated building energy reductions achieved through integration of building Energy Conservation Measures.,B66,Supply Bldg,
,,B192,GPV Garage,
Building Network Interface,,B8,Exercise Support Office,
,·         New hot-water energy transfer stations consisting of one or more brazed-plate or flat plate heat exchangers will replace existing steam convertors in each connected building,B174,CE Roads and Grounds Bldg,
,·         It is assumed that the district heating supply will provide both space heating and domestic water heating for each connected building,B81,Electrical and Sheet Metal Shop,
,,B80,Roundel Cleaners (NPF),
Questions  for 4 Wing. Please answer below.,,B10,Standby Power Plant,
,·         Please confirm the buildings that are still using steam directly in terminal heating equipment. See list at right. Please name the terminal equipment that use steam coils.,B6,RM Storage,
,,B128,WOps EOD Centre # 19,
,"·         If known, please provide potential time horizon for any planned changes to the existing steam network and CHP",,,
,,,,
,·         Also confirm if there are any other specific buildings on the Base that should be excluded from the district heating system modelling?,,,
,,,,
,"·         Do any of the buildings currently connected to the steam network have thermal meters installed? If so, can data be provided?",,,
,,,,
,·         Any additional directional information to consider in the analysis – items Cold Lake personnel would like to see included or not included in the analysis?,,,
