Cold Lake modelling assumptions,,,,,
,,,,,
Weather file,Edmonton CWEC,,,,
,Use CWEC; perhaps do a comparison to year using for analysis,,,,
Occupancy ,,,,,
Loads,MNECB defaults; adjusted for actual occupancy as per audit,,,,
Schedule,Actual as per audit or MNECB,,,,
,,,,,
Envelope,R values by building type and vintage (see sheet 'Cold Lake R-values'),scripting,,,
,Use metal cladding construction,,,,
,Set R-values for trailer archeype (not based on vintage) (see sheet 'Cold Lake R-values'),,,,
,"no wall retrofit measures (based on trenton, not cost-effective), perhaps only roof ecms ",,,,
,,,,,
Infiltration,Rate by building type and vintage (see sheet 'Infiltration Assumptions'),scripting,,,
bay doors,increase infiltration rate by 50% when doors are opened (see audit info),,,,
,,,,,
Lighting,,,,,
Loads,MNECB defaults; some audit information available ,Question: ask base contact about when lighting retrofits were done; provide MNECB default and ask if that is in the ball park.,,,
Heat to space,Set based on building type; to be determined,Check if detailed lighting plans available for exemplar buildings; need to check if these were implemented,,,
Schedule,Same as occupancy schedule as per audit or MNECB default by space type,,,,
,,,,,
Equipment,,,,,
Loads,MNECB defaults; do we take into account loads in server rooms?,no; we will not tackle process loads,,,
Schedule,MNECB defaults,,,,
,,,,,
HVAC,,,,,
heating system capacity,auto-sized,,,,
cooling system capacity,auto-sized,,,,
cooling,"for spaces with occupants only (example offices, but not storage spaces); set up systems appropriately (system with no cooling for zones with no cooling)",,,,
combine HVAC systems,yes,,,,
modify HVAC system by vintage,no,,,,
,put cooling in exemplar with no cooling if other buildings for this archetype have cooling,,,,
economizers,assume in all base case models for buildings with cooling,,,,
exhaust fans,explicitly model. This is necessary if we look at exhaust fan ecm - modify exhaust fan schedule to determine impact.,,,,
humidification/dehumidification,no for humidification; dehumidification accounted for by cooling,,,,
ventilation,MNECB outdoor air per person rates,,,,
heating setpoint,Set to 20C,,,,
cooling setpoint,Set to 24C,,,,
temperature setback,not in base model,,,,
boiler with outdoor air reset,not in base model; consider as ECM,assumed to exist in DES heated buildings,,,
boiler capacity,auto-sized,,,,
boiler efficiency,"actual if available, 80% for DES systems",,,,
boiler setpoint,82C,script,,,
des,Des represented by boiler with 80% efficiency,,,,
HVAC system heating efficiency,"actual, if available or use 80% default",,,,
HVAC system cooling efficiency,vintage COP: 2.5 for systems pre-1980; 3.0 for 1980-2004; 3.5 post-2004,script; set base model to 2.5,,,
fan schedule,as per audit; if no information assume always on,,,,
fan motor efficiency,see ,script,,,
fan type,constant,,,,
hvac ventilation schedule,always on,,,,
hvac night control,assume zone thermal units (if applicable) can cycle on to meet heating setpoint,,,,
pump motor efficiency,by vintage; see Mike,script,,,

SWH,,,,,
peak flow,"based on MNECB default of W/person, actual occupancy and 44C temperature difference",,,,
water tank capacity,default size,,,,
water tank efficiency,actual if available otherwise 80% for fuel-fired; 100% for electric (standby losses taken into account separately),,,,
schedule,based on default for predominant MNECB space type,,,,
water heater pump,constant,,,,
fuel type ,based on audit,,,,
hot water setpoint temperature,60C,script,,,
,,,,,
Utility costs,use time of use rate for one base case model- office; compare to result with average rate,,,,
,"rates, see Matthew",,,,
,take into account demand and consumption charges,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Simulation outputs,,,,,
,,,,,
Yearly ,,,,,
load versus consumption,EUI based on energy (versus consumption); analysis will use load values and assume system efficiency,,,,
,also compile #s based on consumption to compare,,,,
