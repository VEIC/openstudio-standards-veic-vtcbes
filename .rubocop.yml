# Allow variable initialization to indicate
# what variable is going to be set by the next
# block of code.
Lint/UselessAssignment:
  Enabled: false

# Allow unused arguments in anticipation that
# those arguments will be used in the future.
# The ruby _arg convention will not be understood
# by many of the non-Rubyists maintaining the code.
Lint/UnusedMethodArgument:

# ==================== Styles ====================
  
# WordArray enforces how array literals of word-like strings should be expressed.
# Enforce ['Word1', 'Word2'] for readability
Style/WordArray:
  EnforcedStyle: brackets

# Disabled because in most of this codebase,
# the current approach is more readable.
Style/GuardClause:
  Enabled: false  

# Allow this type of nesting for logic clarity.
Style/IfInsideElse:
  Enabled: false  
 
# This library encourages explicit returns for clarity

# code that does certain tasks more consolidated.
Style/IdenticalConditionalBranches:
  Enabled: false  

# Do not force people to use Next.

# ==================== Naming ====================

# Ignore file name convention; choices based on OpenStudio C++ class names
Naming/FileName:
  Enabled: false

# Intentionally allow set_foo because these methods do not
# take have cooresponding getters.
