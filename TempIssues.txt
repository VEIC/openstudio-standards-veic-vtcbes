* Added Template sheet, reference this data.  Or add this to lookup sheet

* Either create standards table and make all instances of standards list this, or extend standards listed in the lookup sheet to include all types of standards (construction, etc). 

* Add option bcl uuid for weather file component for each climate zone

* Added table for Climate Zone Sets

* Space types tab - change climate zone to reference entry in climate zone sets tab

* Create tab for building and space types, this is a "view" only table editing should be disabled.  The building and space types are still defined on the space types tab, find all unique building type and space type combinations and list them.  This suggests building type and space type for future space types but can be overridden.

* I don't understand the Ventilation, Occupancy, InteriorLighting tabs.  They seem to have duplicate data that is already in the space types tab.  Are these needed to support the space types tab?  Should these be hidden or deleted?

* I don't think we need the ConstructionStandards tab for now, can we just leave it blank?  Seems like that should also have the targeted U-values, etc in it for checking our constructions against or generating new ones.
